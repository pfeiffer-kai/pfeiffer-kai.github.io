After originally studying Mechanical Engineering in Germany I came into first contact with the robotics world during an internship in Japan developing the control of an exoskeleton. Having concentrated on numerical methods for FEM solving in my studies, I was fascinated by written code actually setting machinery in motion. Therefore I continued with a master thesis of identifying the inertial parameters of the little NAO robot (International Journal of Humanoid Robotics, 2018). Being able to continue working with humanoid robots in Japan I took the great chance of pursuing a PhD under the supervision of Prof. Abderrahmane Kheddar and Dr. Adrien Escande. Besides designing and implementing robot demonstrations (robot nut torquing task, IROS, 2017) I work on more theoretical problems, namely kinematic and algorithmic singularity resolution for hierarchical least squares solvers in inverse kinematics (RAL/IROS, 2018) and dynamics.
